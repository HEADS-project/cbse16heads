Some attempts of creating an "\textit{Esperanto2 of the programming languages}" have emerged, aiming at replacing the need for using multiple programming languages. For example, Haxe~\cite{dasnois2011haxe} is a programming language that cross-compile to most of the popular programming languages (Java, JavaScript, C++ and others). A significant development effort in Haxe, beyond the development of the language and compilers, is put in the development of a standard library (mostly wrapping the standard libraries of the targeted languages). This standard library needs to be embedded at runtime with a too large overhead to run on the most constrained platforms our approach is able to target. 

In the CBSE domain, some component platforms are available for different languages. For example, Fractal~\cite{bruneton2006fractal} is implemented in Java and C. However, no significant effort has been put to make the different platforms to interoperate
