\section{Conclusion}
%The conclusion goes here.

This paper mainly relates an experiment in using a multi-view point approach for designing complex eHealth system. This approach proposes the use of several viewpoints and several modelling languages based on well-established formalisms (a component and state machine-based language for design and implementation, and a configuration language for deployment) dedicated to the integration, deployment and continuous operation of existing libraries and components already available in various languages. 

The experiment shows that this approach can be used in an industrial context by a small team of engineering (TellU being an SME with about 10 developers) to create a real eHealth system. This experiment also shows that the use of these modeling languages associated with an extensible generative framework to support new platforms provide a solution to create modular applications that can be developed iteratively and easily reconfigured at runtime. 

As a current work, we are creating a set of reusable components and connectors relevant for the eHealth, to provide advanced security mechanism in term of privacy and security.
