\section{Conclusion}
%The conclusion goes here.

This paper mainly relates an experiment in using a multi-view point approach for designing complex eHealth system. This approach proposes the use of several viewpoints and several modelling languages based on well-established formalisms (components with port and messages for the interfaces and state machines for the implementation)  dedicated to the integration, deployment and continuous operation of existing libraries and components already available and implemented in various languages. 

The experiment shows that this approach can be used in an industrial context by a small SME engineering team to create a real eHealth system. This experiment also shows that the use of a modeling language based on components with port and messages for the interfaces and state machines for the implementation associated with an extensible generative framework to support new platforms and integrated with a configuration language to manage the deployment and the configuration of this service provide a solution to create modular applications that cann be easily reconfigured and migrate on a new platforms. 

As a current work, we are creating a set of reusable component and connectors for the eHealth domain. In particular, we aims at providing a set of software modules (component and connector)  to provide advanced security mechanism in term of privacy and security.
